  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>My name is Zach, and I am currently studying Computer Science with a focus on developing practical and user-centered 
    software solutions. I enjoy working on web development projects, small applications, and systems that help improve 
    efficiency and usability. I value clean design, clear functionality, and continuous learning. As I continue to expand my 
    skills, I aim to contribute to meaningful projects and grow within the technology field. </p>
